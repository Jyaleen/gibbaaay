ARTG3250 Project 2: Tangible Inputs/Game Controller

Grubtime for Gibby is an interactive micro:bit and Scratch-based game. It allows players to maneuver Gibby using a micro:bit in order to gobble as many bananas (Gibby loves bananas!) as possible while dodging kebabs (Gibby wants bananas, not kebabs). 

We had fun making the bobbing animation for the title as well as adding sound effects to help make the game more interactive. It was difficult to figure out the math behind each sprite's motion and to keep track of the logic, but with better code organization, we were able to come out of this with a fun and interesting game!
